# Running Shoe CLI

Running Shoe Selector is a command line interface that allows the user to receive a recommendation of the highest-rated, best-reviewed shoe for a variety of running styles.

The app introduces itself and asks the user and provides a description of the app's functionality. When the user inputs the type of running shoe that they are looking for, the app will return the suggested shoe for that runner type - including model, price and a brief description. When the user types in 'exit', the app will say a brief goodbye message.

```bash
